# Unit Testing Project - DEVOAM 202

## üéØ Introduction

In the world of software development, testing plays a crucial role in ensuring the **quality** and **reliability** of applications. Two commonly used methodologies to verify functionality are **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **traditional unit testing**. This project explores both approaches through practical exercises, implementing assertions using **JUnit** and **Hamcrest**, and focusing on different classes and their functionalities.

## üìù Exercises Overview

### Exercice 1: TDD with Simple Calculator Methods

#### Objective:
- **Define tests** for the methods: `calculAdd`, `calculSub`, `calculDiv`, and `calculMultiple` before implementing them in the `CalculTDD` class.

#### Process:
1. Write the **test cases** for each method.
2. Implement the `CalculTDD` class and its methods to make the tests pass.

#### Result:
Tests were successful after the implementation of the methods.

---

### Exercice 2: Writing Tests for the `User` Class

#### Objective:
- Write tests for the `User` class and its methods before implementing them (following TDD).

#### Process:
1. Write **failing tests** since the methods do not exist yet.
2. Implement the `User` class and necessary methods to pass the tests.

#### Result:
Tests passed successfully after implementing the class and methods.

---

### Exercice 3: Traditional Implementation for Calculator Methods

#### Objective:
- Implement methods (`calculAdd`, `calculSub`, `calculDiv`, and `calculMultiple`) in the `Calcul` class using traditional methods.

#### Process:
1. Implement the methods in the `Calcul` class.
2. Write unit tests for each method using **JUnit** and **Hamcrest** assertions.

#### Result:
Tests passed successfully, and the results were as expected.

### Exercice 4: User Management with `UserManager`

#### Objective:
- Implement a class `UserManager` to manage a list of users, with methods to **add**, **delete**, and **update** users.

#### Process:
1. Write the **unit tests** for the `UserManager` class using **JUnit** and **Hamcrest** assertions.
2. Implement the `UserManager` class and methods to pass the tests.

#### Result:
Tests passed successfully, and the implementation worked as expected.

## üìä Conclusion

Through these exercises, we applied and compared **TDD** and the **traditional unit testing** approach. This gave us a deeper understanding of the benefits of **TDD**, such as its role in **test-driven design**, as well as the flexibility of traditional unit tests for validating existing functionalities.

Both approaches are essential for creating **robust** and **maintainable code** in real-world projects.
